# AWS AVAILIBILTY ZONES

## Each region has many availibility zones(usually 3 , min is 3 , max is 6)

### For example: AWS REGION: SYDNEY

### ap-southeast-2a

### ap-southeast-2b

### ap-southeast-2c

## Each availibility zone(AZ) is one or more descrete data centers with redundant power , networking and connectivity

## That means that ap-southeast-2, we could have two data centers

## it could be any amount of data centers 2 in ap-southeast-2a

## They are seperate from each other so they are isolated from disasters
