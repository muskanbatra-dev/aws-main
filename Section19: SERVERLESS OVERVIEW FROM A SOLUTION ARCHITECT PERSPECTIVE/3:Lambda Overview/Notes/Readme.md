# LAMBDA OVERVIEW

# WHY AWS LAMBDA

## Lets take an example we have amazon ec2 , as we know they are virtual servers in the cloud and we have to provision them, so we are limited by the RAM and CPU, CONTINOUSLY RUNNING

## Scalling means intervention to ADD/REMOVE servers

## virtual FUNCTIONS - no servers to manage!

## limited by time - short executions

## Run - on demand

## Scalling is automated
